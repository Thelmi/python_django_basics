class representatio of the data you will
be dealing with

and then for each Model, Django will
automatically create a database
table where you can store
the concrete instances of that Model
and it will give you commands 

update them,
delete them
query them
order them

and no sql code 
which you have to write

// actual code

class Meetup(models.Model): // Model is the base class 

	title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
/* name of the coloumn title it expect text and max length
is 200
*/

slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)
/*
	no space.. no two rows in the database can have the same value in the slug field.
*/
description = models.TextField()
/*
	for longer text text 
*/
