// its many to many because one meetup can have many Participant
and one participant can have many meetups

/* participant = models.ManyToManyField(Participant, )
	Django will treat an extra table, 
	a matching table between these two models you could say
	where one row is added per relation
	
	Note: that we dont need to have any related records at
	all because initially a meetup has no participant
	
	participant = models.ManyToManyField(Participant, blank=True )
	
	blank=True, can be used in any field and it allows it to be empty
	
	This will ensure that if a new entry is added, through
	the admin dashboard, for example, the input there in the
	forum maybe empty
