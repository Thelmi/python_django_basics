//one to many is the same as many to one

/*  Three kinds of relationship
	
	one to many: one book as one author, one author wrote
	multiple books
	
	one to one: one author has one address, one address
	belongs to one author
	
	many to many: A book can be published in many countries
	a country can publish many books
*/

// in location example its one to many

because on location can belong to many meetups 
but one meetup will only have one location
