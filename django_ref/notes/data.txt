// not official clasification of data
// howver make sense
// so what is Data ?

/*
	there are three types of data.
	
	Temperory Data
	Semi-Persistent Data
	Persistent Data

*/
Temporary data: is the data user entered into an input field
	in other words its some data which matters at a specific moment
	but which ultimitly will be lost
	if a user enters something into an unput field
	once this form is submitted that data might be stored in a database
	but the data in the input field will probably be reset
/*
	User input. 
	Selected Blog post.
	
	Data is used and immediately and lost thereafter
	store in Memory (variables)
*/
Semi-persistent Data: If you log in, and then reload it shouldnt be lost
	but ofc at some point you might be locked out automatically and if 
	that log in status is forgotten or lost,, its not the end
	of the world. because you can easily receate it by logging in again
/*
	User Authentication status
	Data is stored for a longer time but may be lost
	(can be receated)
	stored in Browser, Temporary Files 
	(storages like, cookies, local storage, or with help of a session)
*\

in other world, Semi-persistent Data: can be persistent, but at
some point it will be cleared, it could be cleared accidently
and it can easily be restored

Persistent Data: should not be lost

/*
e.g
	Users which you stored in your database,
	or to product on an online shop, or the
	blog posts on online shop.
	(Data is stored forever and must not be lost)
	(store in a Database)
