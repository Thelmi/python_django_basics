	the hard drive... we can defined where it should be
	stored and then it will just store a refrence
	basically the path of the file on your hard drive 
	in the database. its not the uploaded file that will 
	be stored,
	but just a pointer to that file 
	you should not store intire files in a database
	that is not what database is optimized for

	for different models... pdf documents... Images...
	then you typically dont want to store them all into
	the same folder but you might have one root upload 
	folder and then you have sub folders like images
	inside of that root folder where the uploaded file
	get stored in
