templates allow us to pre-define HTML files
which we can then enrich with dynamic data
with the help of out python code... our Django code. it can be helpful
in loading data... for now, we learning about static template
which has nothing to do with static
data

/*
	The folder should be named templates
	because it is called like that in settings of
	the project. create a folder with the name of the app
	and make in the template folder, what django will do 
	behind the scenes that will take all the templates from
	your apps and merge them to a giant template folder so
	and if you didnt add your app name as sub folder, you there
	for can have clashes, if you have multiple apps with templates
	similar name
	what render will do is it will create a HTTP response behind the scenes
	but a response configured to returnd a rendered, which means a prepared
	template because I mentioned that templates can also have dynamic data injected
	render needs two arguements
	the arguement and the path to templates
	template is not considered in the path
