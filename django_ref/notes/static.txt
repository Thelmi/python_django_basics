when we wanna add css or javascript content
without being influenced by python then 
it basically not changing by it
front end team prepare that code and 
attach it to html is in static

/*
	again Django will look into such a
	static folder this folder should hold 
	all the static folders needed by ur folder
	do app name folder because all of them, will 
	get merge same like in templates
	a good practice is to have sub sub folders
	as styles and scripts
	it wont be auto injected in our django file
	
	Now django template language
	
	you can let django figuere out the URL 
	without hard coding the file in html

	{% static 'meetups/styles/base.css' %}
	and then above to unlock it 
	{% load static %}
