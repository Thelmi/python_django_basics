// for dynamic_path in urls

path(meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>)
slug keyword... give rules to the path
<> to make it dynamic

// in view 
def meetup_details(request, meetup_slug):

// using url keyword 

path("meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>/", views.meetup_details, name='meetup-detail') // third parameter for path

and then use 'URL keyword'
<a href="{% url 'meetup-detail' meetup_item.slug %}" class="btn">More Details</a>

// in Url.py do the dynamic path the last

// this is better than this

// this is not correct because succes might be in the slug url

/* 
path("meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>/", views.meetup_details, name='meetup-detail')
path("meetups/success", views.confirm_registration, name='registration-success')
*/

correct is to put it, in this order

/*

path("meetups/success", views.confirm_registration, name='registration-success')
path("meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>/", views.meetup_details, name='meetup-detail')
