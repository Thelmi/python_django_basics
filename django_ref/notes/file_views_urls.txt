 apps file: 
	gives it a name based on the
	file app name

models.py:
	is important when you start adding
	data models to your app

tests.py helps in unit testing:
	and automated tests

what will matter is the views.py
	file because that actully when
	we will start writing some logic

Url file in the project is important since
We will control which routes, and which url 
website support

// what is view?

int the simplist form its just a python function

there you might have a funcion called index (name of starting html..) // you can name it anything

in that function you need to respond to the browser...
that tell to the browser what to display on the screen
the function will be called manually by Django

\*
	the index function will be invoked automatically when have an incoming
	request for a certain Url, so we must return an http response
	
	it also takes an request arguement
	every app should have its own Urls that belongs to the app
	and then we can connect them all the global project app
	
	there in app url we should have a variable exactly named
	"urlpatterns"
	assigned to it a list
	inside of the list
	should have a path() that has been imported form django.urls
	calling path returns a urlpatterns object here
	
	it takes to args
	path('meetups') # this path should be active if our-domain.com/meetups is requested
	after importing my views module we can point at method in that module
	path('meetups', views.index) adding a slash is a good idea
	at last you should go to the project and add your app
	in settings there is Installed Apps
