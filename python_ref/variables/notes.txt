price = 9.99 this will be considered as a float

x = 15

price = 9.99

discount = 0.2

result = price * (1 - discount)

print(result)

A string:

name = "Rolf"

u can re assign as well

name = "BOB"

if you wrote name *= 2

its like saying name + name basically (strjoin)


name = "Rolf"

print(name);

name = "taha"
print(name * 2);

a = 25

b = a

print(b) // b same as a

b = 100

print("b:", b, sep=' ') // b changed
print("a:", a, sep=' ') // a didnt change
